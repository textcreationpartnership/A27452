            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am deſired by my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Friend and Tutor, M. <hi>Mark Franck,</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Fellow of Pembrook Hall, <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to read this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his old acquaintance Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Jackſon,</hi> Chirurgeon, and to write my thoughts, as an Epiſtle before it; in obedience whereof I ſhall briefly addreſs my ſelf. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Author to be <hi>Jacobus Carpus Bononienſis</hi> (becauſe of his Figures, as alſo his mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Commentaries upon <hi>Mundinus)</hi> printed in Latine in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty, about one hundred
<pb facs="tcp:55400:5"/> and thirty years agoe. Hee was in his time much eſteemed for a moſt induſtrious, judicious, and expert Anatomist, and hath in this Book given good teſtimony thereof, for he hath in this <hi>Iſagoge</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly much improved the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> of Anatomy, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficult parts of it, which is one of the principal qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an Anatomiſt; therefore its hoped this Book will bee as well worth the reading as any in that particular, by whoſoever that will favour that ever Noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exerciſe. Moreover, this good old Author is conciſe and ſhort, without any tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, and alſo writ in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good order and method, and will neither ſpend time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor charge conſiderable. Its hoped the Reader will eaſily bee perſwaded to indulge this Writer with the common abatement ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb facs="tcp:55400:5"/> granted to all our ancient Authors.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that he writ ſo long before our for ever renowned Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> and therefore was not acquainted with thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truths of the circuit of the bloud, which evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that the Veins reduce that bloud which was ſent by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from the Heart abroad into the parts of the Body, and that the Heart with the Bloud and Spirits, is the chief Organ of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the habitacle of the ſpirit of Life, common to us with Brutes: but the Brain, the <hi>Primum ſenſorium,</hi> the ſeat of the Intellect, the complement of man, and the palace of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul.</p>
            <p>The other excuſe to bee entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Author of this Work, is alſo for his age; for hee lived before our incomparable Doctor
<pb facs="tcp:55400:6"/> 
               <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> had demonſtrated the true uſes of the Liver; the exact way of Natures making Bloud; the nature and courſe of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, and the motion of the Chyle; and that the Splene poures no juyce, either ſowre or ſweet into the Stomach: which being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, our Author may happily paſs compleatly current.</p>
            <p>Formerly <hi>Italy</hi> bred many ſuch learned Phyſicians and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers as this Author, and then it was worth the while to journey to <hi>Padua</hi> to hear them, as other Nations anciently went into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: But now <hi>England</hi> by the industry of <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> is the only Scene for both; ſo that the politick <hi>Italian,</hi> if he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the attaining to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any thing conſiderable in either, muſt viſit <hi>England,</hi> and ours ſtay to better purpoſe at home, unleſs the careful Father ſhall

            <p>But becauſe we muſt begin from the whole as being beſt known; Firſt, ſome dead body being laid with his face upward, in a place fit for diſſection &amp; demonſtration, being before waſhed, the hairs ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and very well cleanſed from filth, even from the head to the feet; we muſt know, that the body is divided into four parts, that is, into three notable Bellies, and the extreams, to wit, the hands and the feet, with ſome others.</p>

               <p> The Matrix which is alſo called <hi>Vulva,</hi> hath two parts, to wit, a Receptacle, or <hi>Sinus,</hi> or hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>Cervix,</hi> or <hi>Collum,</hi> a Neck, and it is a Member creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Nature for increaſe; the ſubſtance of its Receptacle is Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowy, mixed of the Chords of a Ligament and confuſed fleſh, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a little ſenſible, and it is compounded of one onely Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, circumvolved with the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neon,</hi> and it is Sinnowy, that it might bee extended in Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that it might bee gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to a little quantity in the Birth; alſo all its hollowneſs is moved to the Center in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sperm, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and toucheth it with its ſides.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck is the Yard placed in Copulations.</p>
               <p>Between the Neck and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle within, is a certain pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licular ſubſtance, fleſhy, ſenſible enough, perforated in the middle, that may be dilated and conſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called <hi>Os Matricis,</hi> the Mouth of the Matrix, having the form of a Mullets head, otherwiſe of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi> or of the Tench fiſh, or of a new bred Puppy; which in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations, and Births, and <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strues,</hi> is opened by the order of nature, but at other times, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it is pregnant, it is ſo ſhut, that a ſmall needle cannot enter into it, unleſs with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>The Shape of its Neck is very long, round, hollow, it is as much unviolated as is the Yard of him that doth copulate therewith, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55400:63"/> in a Virgin it is leſs.</p>
               <p>This hath about the middle of it, the Virginal pannicle, like a Net woven together of ſmall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and very many Veins, which one violated, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, becauſe it is broke in the firſt copulation with a man; this Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle is called <hi>Eugion,</hi> and <hi>Cento,</hi> and <hi>Imen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the extream part of the Neck, on the ſides are added Skins, which are called <hi>Praeputia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within the Neck, a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Os Pectinis,</hi> doth enter a ſhort Neck of the Bladder, whoſe Orifice is ſhut up of certain ſmall, fleſhy, and pannicular Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which, and of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Praeputia,</hi> by reaſon of the Ayr, there is cauſed ſome noiſe in making water.</p>
               <p>The Shape of the Receptacle is Quadrangular, with ſome round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hollow below as the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>In the Receptacle towards the Neck, there is on both ſides one Ligamental additament faſtned to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55400:63"/> the Back toward the <hi>Anchae,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Shape of a Snails horn, therefore theſe are called, the Horns of the Matrix.</p>
               <p>About theſe Horns on both ſides, is one Teſticle, harder, and leſs than in a man, not perfectly round, but preſt together like an Almond; in them are ingendred Sperm, not groſs, as in a man, nor hot, but watery, thin, and cold.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Teſticles have not one Pannicle, in which they may be both contained, as is the <hi>Scrotum</hi> in a man, but each hath a proper Pannicle, riſen from the <hi>Peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> faſtning them about the Horns; and each of them hath one ſmall muſcle, of which it is moved.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Teſticles are implanted the aforeſaid Seminary veſſels, which being called <hi>Praeparantia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the <hi>Chilis,</hi> and from <hi>Aorta,</hi> and from the Emulgents; from thence do reach other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, named <hi>Deportantia,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpreading themſelves unto the Receptacle, and they bring Sperm within the hollowneſs of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:55400:64"/>
               <p> The Orifices of theſe Veſſels are called <hi>Foſſulae,</hi> and <hi>Cotilidones;</hi> through them flow the <hi>Menſtrues,</hi> from them doth the young one draw Nutriment by the Umbeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veins and Arteries faſtned to the aforeſaid <hi>Foſſulae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a woman there are not the Veſſels <hi>Paraſtata,</hi> nor the Veſſel <hi>Epididymum,</hi> becauſe in a woman the ſoft Veſſels are not offenſive to the Teſticles, as they are in a man through their hardneſs.</p>
               <p>The whole Matrix with its Teſticles and Seminary veſſels, is like to the Members of Generation in men: but the Members of men are compleat, expelled forth by reaſon of their heat; but of women they are diminiſhed, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within for their want of heat.</p>
               <p>And the Matrix is as it were the converted Inſtrument, for the Neck of the Matrix is as the Yard, and its Receptacle with the Teſticles and Veſſels is even as the Cod.</p>
               <p>For in the Cod being turned
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55400:64"/> in, there is a hollowneſs within it; and without it, being likewiſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in, there do lie the Teſticles and Seminary veſſels, as in the Receptacle of the Matrix, but the Teſticles and Veſſels of men are greater.</p>
               <p>The Situation of the Fiſſure of the Matrix is between the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Os Pectinis,</hi> and the place which is between both Orifices, is called <hi>Perinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Neck aſcendeth above from the Fiſſure through the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unto the Receptacle, whoſe place is between the <hi>Rectum</hi> and the Bladder; all theſe are placed long-waies in the hollowneſs of the Little trough.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in Damoſels, is ſmall, and leſs than their Bladder; neither is its hollowneſs filled, unleſs with the filling of the increaſe of the body, whereof it is: but in full grown (unleſs it be great with young) it is not much greater than may bee comprehended in a hand; but it increaſeth by reaſon of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55400:65"/> 
                  <hi>Menſtrues,</hi> having walls, as it were, fleſhy, thick, and groſs, but in one pregnant, it is very much ſtretched, and thin, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Sinnowy, and then it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth towards the Navil, more and leſs, according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the young one.</p>
               <p>It hath onely one concavity or Cell, which nevertheleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what toward the bottom of it, is divided into two parts, as if they were two Matrixes, both end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one Neck.</p>
               <p>In the right ſide of it, for the moſt part are faſtned the Male, in the left the Female.</p>
               <p>It hath Colligancy with the Brain by Nerves, with the Heart by Arteries, with the Liver and Teats by Veins, with the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Rectum</hi> by Pannicles, with the Bladder by the Neck of it, which is ſhort, not penetrating without, as in a man; with the <hi>Anchae</hi> by the horns (but of the horns above) The Receptacle is every way looſe, and therefore falleth to the ſides, and ſometimes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55400:65"/> its Receptacle goeth altogether forth out of the body, through the Neck of it.</p>
               <p>The Number of it is apparent, and perhaps hee doth not erre that ſaith there are two Matrixes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are two Concavities as two hollow hands, touching one another, covered with the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Pannicle terminated at one Chanel,</p>
               <p>And that you may ſomewhat ſatisfie your ſelf, of its Figure, Place, and Situation, you may ſee the under-written Figures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following; to the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which let not him come which is not ingenuous and expert in Lines, and Shadow, or in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which doth much help Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and many other Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; the Native complexion of the Matrix actuated by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is hot and moiſt; its helps are to purge the body of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bloody Superfluity; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to conſerve the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>

               <p>It may ſuffer every kinde of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55400:66"/> diſeaſe; it often falleth down, and it may all bee drawn forth out of the body, the health remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. One Matrix being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I ſaw drawn wholly forth by my Father in the Land of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> which was cured, and lived long.</p>

               <p>One other being corrupted, my Kinſ-man (by my brother) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianius,</hi> drew wholly forth in my preſence, in the Aſſembly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Docters and Scholars, <hi>anno Domini</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty, the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> that laſt by name. <hi>Gentilis</hi> was the Wife of <hi>Chriſtopher Briantus</hi> of <hi>Mediolanum,</hi> inhabitant at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>

               <p>The Bones of it are not united, as in the Head, but divided, that the Breaſt might bee obedient to the motion of breathing; and therefore for its motion there are muſcles in it; <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid 7 <hi>de U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilit:</hi> If the Breaſt were made of muſcles onely, they would fall upon the Heart and Lungs; that therefore there might bee ſome ſpace between, and that in like manner the whole Organ might be moved, the muſcles are placed to the Bones by courſe.</p>
               <p>This Belly called <hi>Pectus</hi> is great in quantity, becauſe it ſerves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great members, yet it hath

               <p>In a man the Breaſt is broad, not carinated, as in the greater part of Beaſts, yet it is broader in a man than in a woman; but for the bearing of the young, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Belly is greater in a woman than in a man; and for this reaſon the Region of the Reins, of the bone <hi>Sacrum,</hi> and the <hi>Ancharum</hi> in a woman is very large.</p>

               <p>In the unviolent motion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, do ſerve the muſcles between the Ribs, dilating the Breaſt; alſo the motion of the Heart and Lungs do ſerve it, for whilſt the <hi>Diafragma</hi> is moved, it draweth the Lungs, which is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Ayr like a Breaſt plate, and dilateth the Breaſt, the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               <p>And creatures which have a little Heart, are bold; but they are fearful which have a great one; as by the proportion to Mice, to

               <p>It is reported, that ſome men have been born with a hairy Heart, and theſe are more bold and ſtronger than others; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Ariſtomenes Meſſanius,</hi> which ſlew three hundred <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and hee, when he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and taken, at length eſcaped, getting away through a Cave of Foxes; being taken the ſecond time, hee being adventurous, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped; the third time being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> cut o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Breaſt for the cauſe of ſeeing his man-hood, and his Heart was found hairy.

               <p>Its upper part wherewith it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the upper members, and is faſtned to the Back, is broad; and this part is the more noble of the parts of the Heart, becauſe the life of a living creature is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the means of two Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Arteries of the left ſide, coming from that part; but the bottom doth gather it ſelf into a ſharp figure, and goeth out almoſt into a ſwords point; and in the former part it is eminent.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55400:96"/> ſituation of the <hi>Chilis,</hi> and the aſcendent Artery upon theſe may be ſeen, to which theſe two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are a coverlet; you ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo keep the Heart and its <hi>Capſula,</hi> and the Pannicle <hi>Mediaſtinus,</hi> and the Stomach, and alſo the Midriff, for the enquiring of other things of them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things being kept, for better orders ſake, I come firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpeech of the Neck, and I term the Neck to be an Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal member, noble, and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a man for the members contained in it, which witneſs <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 3 <hi>de partibus, Cap.</hi> 3. is made for the <hi>Trachea,</hi> ſerving to the Lungs, and for the <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> in his eighth book <hi>de juvamentis, Cap.</hi> 1. ſaith, that it is principally for the Lungs, becauſe creatures wanting a Neck, want Lungs, as Fiſhes: but he addeth, that the Neck is the way of thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which deſcend from above downward &amp; of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55400:97"/> deſcend, are the Nerves, the <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> ſome muſcles, and the <hi>Nuca;</hi> but the aſcending, are the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Veins, and the quiet: and the <hi>Nuca</hi> is contained of the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, that it may bee ſafe from outward hurts; and that hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is between the parts of the Veins and Arteries, is filled by glandules remaining there; and all thoſe are kept of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings and Ligaments, after that they are all covered with the Skin; and that which is compounded of all thoſe, is the Neck, which is placed for the Cane of the Lungs, by which is made the voice and breathing; alſo the Neck in ſome creatures is inſtead of a Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take their meat from the earth by the help of the Neck, by reaſon of the length of their feet. But of this ſort the Neck ſerves for the Cane of the Lungs, and by means of it the Nerves do reach to the Arms, and to the Hands, and to the <hi>Diafragma,</hi> and to other members, the <hi>Nuca</hi> being their guide; and therefore for the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55400:97"/> Original of the Nerves were the Spondiles placed between the Breaſt and the Head, of which the Neck is compounded. Theſe things <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaketh, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſaith not whether the <hi>Trachea</hi> aſcend or deſcend; and although hee may ſay, that the <hi>Gula</hi> doth deſcend, yet perhaps it doth aſcend, neither can its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent bee proved more than its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; neither of the <hi>Trachea;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not a manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as Veins and Arteries, and as Nerves.</p>
               <p>Wee may therefore ſay for the preſent, that the Neck is taken for that part upon which the Head is ſuſtained and turned, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the upper Belly, to the middle, and alſo to the lower, by means of Nerves deſcending from the Brain, and from the <hi>Nuca;</hi> the ſituation of which is before from the upper <hi>Furculaes</hi> of the Breaſt, and behinde from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Spondile of the Ribs, and on the ſides from above the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unto the bone of the Head

               <p>Another branch greater than all the aforeſaid five, reacheth to the <hi>Axilla,</hi> or Armpit, and this is divided into four parts, one of them is ſpread in the muſcles pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the Breaſt, which move the <hi>Spatulaes,</hi> and one entteth in the looſe fleſh, and in certain Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of the <hi>Axillaes,</hi> and one goeth from the upper part of the Breaſt about the Teats, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> and this (according to ſome) nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and in part carrieth the matter of milk to them; and this (as wee have ſaid elſewhere) is coupled in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> with a Vein aſcending from the <hi>Ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and from the Matrix to the Teats; and of that branch <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaketh, in 14 <hi>de utilit. part. cap.</hi> 8. ſaying, That from the <hi>Thorax</hi> do reach Veins to the <hi>Hypocondria,</hi> and to the whole <hi>Epigaſtrion,</hi> and are coupled with Veins which are

               <p>And the aforeſaid manifeſt <hi>Guidez</hi> on both ſides notable, is immediately under the Skin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the muſcles of the Neck, which with its branches doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the upper and lower Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Tongue, and the Head, aſcending on the outſide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ears.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55400:105"/> it is gathered by the good Anatomy of the Spermatick veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that the inciſion of theſe Veins behinde the Ears maketh not barren, by reaſon of the Sperm deſcending by them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs thoſe Veins being cut, may weaken the Brain ſo, that it may not duly ſend the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirit for conception; and this the profound <hi>Guidez</hi> may rather do than the manifeſt, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries may rather do this than the Veins, becauſe they are the carriers of the Spirit; but either is poſſible.</p>

               <p>From that Branch aſcended on both ſides immediately above this bone <hi>Baſilare</hi> (according to the Hinges of Phyſick) is made the <hi>Retentirabile;</hi> which is (according to them) of a notable magnitude, which is before, behind, and on the ſides.</p>
               <p>And the aforeſaid Veins nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Brain in their aſcent muſt bee ſuſtained of ſome ſolid body, as is the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> becauſe they cannot aſcend by themſelves for their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and ſoft coat, and the bloud in them is more apt to deſcend than to aſcend, becauſe it is heavie.</p>
               <p>But the Arteries are not joyned to any ſolid body, but ſtanding by themſelves do aſcend too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Skull, becauſe they are double coated and hard.</p>
               <p>And it was not neceſſary that they ſhould aſcend, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turn their heads downward
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55400:107"/> as the Veins, becauſe their bloud is light, and more apt for aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than deſcending.</p>
               <p>Yet you ſhall better ſee the branches of thoſe Veins, and alſo of ſome Arteries in the Anatomy of the Members following.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries hath been ſpoken of in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; their complexion is judged from the compoſition of them; their ſhape is known, they have Colligancy with the whole body; their bigneſs is alſo known; they are bigger in one body than in another; But the ſituation of many of them is often varied; in number they are unperceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe many of them are hidden; their helps are to feed all the members; they alſo ſuffer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of all ſorts, but there often hapneth to them a ſtreightned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation, cauſed from the fulneſs of bloud, which if it bee made in the branches of the Veins <hi>Guidez,</hi> there always followeth profundity of ſleep, the Apoplexie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſuffocation.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:55400:108"/>
               <p> That Vein <hi>Guidez</hi> is ſometimes flebotomized, yet ſeldome in our Region and Age; its inciſion hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Leproſie not confirmed, and in a ſtrong ſquinancy, in a ſharp <hi>Aſtma,</hi> in ſtraightneſs of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hoarſneſs of voice cauſed by ſuper-abounding of blood in an Apoſtume of the Lungs, for evacuation and diverſion ſake, for the antecedent cauſe, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and augmentation; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this inciſion of the Veins <hi>Guidez</hi> is to bee made by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hand, with a Flebm or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, having ſome Obſtacle neer the point, leſt all the ſides of the Vein be opened, for theſe Veins are ſlippery in the touching of them, becauſe they are not annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fleſh, as many others, as well alſo becauſe of the ſoft and ſlippery glandules being under them; as alſo, leſt the Flebm ſhould prick a Nerve or other members placed there.</p>
               <p>But the manner of flebotomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing theſe Veins, is thus; firſt, let the lower Belly of the Patient

               <p>Authors commend ſuch a Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee made according to the breadth, nevertheleſs I would doe it obliquely, and let not the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bloud bee ſuperfluous, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it bee done the ſecond time; and let the Work-man have with him powders conſtringent for ſtopping of Bloud, as <hi>Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick, Sanguis Draconis,</hi> the hairs of a Hare, Mummy, the barks of Frankinſence, Aloes, and the like, and among all let him have Vitriol, or Colcotar, alſo Soot is praiſed, and burnt Beans, and Paper burnt, Skins, and

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55400:110"/> they did not know the operations of them, witneſs <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>De Voce &amp; anhelitu:</hi> And theſe Nerves doe ariſe principally from the ſixth pair of the Nerves of the Brain, and they riſe alſo from the third, and deſcend perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe in ſuch ſort they muſt move the members.</p>
               <p>Theſe Nerves are compounded of many branches, whereof ſome by deſcending (witneſs <hi>Galen)</hi> are ſpread abroad to the Heart, and to its <hi>Capſula,</hi> to the <hi>Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and likewiſe to the Breaſt in the roots of the Ribs, and ſome notable enough to the mouth of the Stomach, and to the <hi>Diafrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and ſome leſſer to the Liver, to the Spleen, to the Kidnies, and to other ſenſible members of the lower Bellies, to which alſo doe goe certain Nerves obliquely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the Nuke, and from thoſe Nerves deſcending ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table branches are again turned back upward, which are called <hi>Reverſivi,</hi> and <hi>Retro Redeuntes,</hi> which are commonly called the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55400:111"/> Nerves of the Voyce, and they reach toward the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with certain of its muſcles, whoſe heads are placed at the lower parts of its body.</p>
               <p>Some branches alſo of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid deſcendent Nerves (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Reverſives) doe goe likewiſe by deſcending to ſome of the Muſcles of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> the heads whereof are turned upward, and they are Reverſives (as it pleaſeth ſome) with their muſcles they ſhut the cartilage <hi>Cymbalaris,</hi> and <hi>Glotida,</hi> but the muſcles of the deſcending Nerves doe move other Cartilages, and alſo they open the <hi>Cymbalaris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the ſeventh pair alſo, and from the <hi>Nuca,</hi> doe come Nerves to the muſcles of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which doe move it obliquely, (witneſſe <hi>Galen.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Nerves are two; one right, the other left, nevertheleſs they are divided into very many Fibers, or branches, as it appears, becauſe of the many members to which they goe.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:55400:111"/>
               <p> Their quantity and colour is apparent; their complexion and ſubſtance is ſuch as of other Nerves, yet the Reverſives are drier and harder, becauſe they are to bear notable, and as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motions, eſpecially when they ſhut the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> to which ſhutting there is required a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger motion than to the opening of it, becauſe there are more muſcles opening than ſhutting it; alſo the motion of the Heart, of the Lungs, and of the Breaſt doth open it; and therefore that ſuch Nerves ſhould bee ſtrong, Nature hath ſet them afarre off from the moyſt Brain, from which by how much the more they are diſtant, by ſo much the more drier are they; and they paſs near unto the Heart about the Artery, where perhaps by reaſon of its heat they doe obtain drineſs and hardneſs, and they are turned back upward, that by drawing downward they might ſhut the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piglottis,</hi> which when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, many other muſcles helping, the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> is opened.</p>

               <p> Their ſituation is on the ſides of the Neck deſcending to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid members, but the Nerves which are called <hi>Reverſivi,</hi> in the left ſide begin to bee turned back to the upper parts, when they meet with the great Artery <hi>Aorta</hi> in the place a little above the Heart, where that Artery is firſt forked, and beginneth to bee turned back through the Breaſt to the lower members, about which great branch deſcending is made the motion of the attraction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of thoſe Nerves, and that bifurcation of the Artery is to thoſe Nerves as a wheel upon which water is drawn from a Well with a cord; and this place as well on the left as on the right, about which theſe reverſive Nerves are moved, or to which they are joyned in their motion, is called of <hi>Galen, Diablum,</hi> and <hi>Flexor;</hi> it is alſo called of ſome <hi>Girgilus,</hi> and <hi>Bachan,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in his eighth Book, <hi>De juvamentis, cap.</hi> 2. doth reſemble that rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Nerves, to thoſe that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55400:112"/> with Horſes in a Camp are turned back to the way from which they firſt came, and ſaith, that it is as it were a turning back of a thing upon a ſmall wheel; and in the ſeventh, <hi>De Utilitate, cap.</hi> 14. hee ſaith, that he firſt of all found out thoſe Nerves placed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and their Muſcles, having the heads of them downward.</p>
               <p>He ſaith alſo, that that reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Nerves ſheweth, that the Nerves have their original from the Brain, and not from the Heart, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did think, for if the Nerves ſhould have their beginning from the Heart, thoſe Reverſives ſhould come from it, and not from the Brain, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to ſence.</p>
               <p>And to thoſe Reverſive Nerves of the right ſide Nature hath alſo made the <hi>Girgilus</hi> (or that wheel which ſhee made in the left ſide) of one ſufficiently noted branch of the Artery aſcending, being obliqued toward the right Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, about the upper <hi>Furcula</hi> of the Breaſt of the right ſide, which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55400:113"/> Artery goeth to the right Arm, to which branch it hath joyned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pellicles remaining there, that it might bee ſtrong, becauſe this branch is not ſo great as is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the reverſive Nerves of the aforeſaid left ſide are turned back.</p>
               <p>And under that branch of the right ſide, fortified of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Pellicles, doe the right rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Nerves aſcend by the Neck; and as well thoſe of the right as of the left are by aſcending, implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the muſcles of the <hi>Epiglot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> with many branches, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to ſence, by means of which they move the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> or <hi>Laringa</hi> voluntarily, as a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by means of his Bridle and Reigns, moveth the Horſe when he liſt.</p>
               <p>The helps of the aforeſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Nerves are to give ſence, and ſome motion (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome) to the members to which they goe in their deſcent, concerning which it was ſpoken before; and the helps of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſives

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55400:122"/> four Motions is ſufficient for them; hee ſaith, that every part of them when it is moved, moveth to its own part, and when two, they are moved to two parts, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to two; they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a perfection of their motion to four parts, neither have they any other motion beſides them.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55400:123"/> the ſides of the Lips are implanted in the Cheeks; and moreover, ſome other do reach from the place behind the ears (which ſometimes they move) unto thoſe Muſcles; nevertheleſs thoſe muſcles are not manifeſtly known, although they have a multitude of Nerves almoſt from all the parts of the Neck; yet they are known if the Lips and the balls of the face bee moved, when the Mandibles are ſhut to their uttermoſt power; not becauſe the bony parts of the Cheeks may be moved, but their aforeſaid fleſhy muſculous part is moved with the skin, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the only motion of the Lips; to which part, and alſo to the very Lips the aforeſaid Broad Muſcles doe goe, which move the Lips, and the Cheek-balls, and this is called the common motion that is of the Lips, and of the Cheek-balls.</p>
               <p>Some alſo would have that the Cheek-balls in their upper part be ſomewhat moved of the Broad Muſcle moving the fore-head, and

               <p>And the motion of thoſe muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are beſt ſeen in thoſe which are living, eſpecially in them that are lean, and therefore I make mention of them, omitting the Anatomy of many muſcles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not bee ſeen in thoſe that are living, neither bee ſhewn in a common Anatomy; I will alſo declare the Anatomy of the Tongue, and Mandibles for the ſame cauſe.</p>

               <p>Under the Tongue it ſelf are two notable Veins, on either ſide one, which in many diſpoſitions are let bloud (eſpecially in the Synanche or Squincy) which are red, ſometimes black, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times green, and they are called of ſome <hi>Raninae.</hi>

               <p>And firſt it is to bee noted, the skin covering their Muſcles, which in men is commonly full of hairs; after which are their proper muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſerving to three motions, to wit, to the motion of opening the mouth, and to the motion of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and to the motion of chawing and grinding; the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on opening maketh the lower Mandibles to deſcend, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting elevateth them; and the grinding motion maketh them turn about, and decline to two parts; it is therefore neceſſary that the motion of ſhutting ſhould be by muſcles which deſcend from above, and draw to the upper parts; and the motion of opening is made on the contrary manner, and that of grinding with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles ſhutting are two, great ones, and having great Chords, which are called the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Temples, becauſe they are faſtned to the Temples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55400:139"/> muſcles of the Eyes are alſo very noble, becauſe they are near to the Brain, but they have not ſo many Nerves as the other, and thoſe two Temporal muſcles are holpen of two other muſcles, which doe goe unto the aforeſaid Mandibles, by the inner part of the Cheek, and the Chords of thoſe Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral muſcles doe not ariſe from the end of the muſcle, but from the middle of it, that they may bee ſtronger.</p>
               <p>But the muſcles opening doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a place called in Arabick <hi>Alhiliricti,</hi> which are two bones called <hi>Acuta, Acularia,</hi> and <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantia,</hi> added to the hinder part of the Head, and thoſe bones are behind the Ears, and theſe two muſcles deſcending are united, and are made one muſcle, afterwards they are ſeparated, and of them is made a Chord that they may bee ſtrong; after that they are again branched, and are filled with fleſh, and the muſcle is made; after that it meeteth with the reflection of the Mandibles, and when it is contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>But the chawing muſcles are two, on either ſide one, which are triangular, and very ſinowy under the balls, and they are ſuch that in the contracting they might have diverſe motions, ſo that by them the grinding and chawing might be compleat, and thoſe muſcles with one of their <hi>Baſis</hi> are about the <hi>Oſſa Paris,</hi> and with one other toward the balls of the Face, and with another toward the Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; yet every angle of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid muſcles is moſt firmly mixed with a part of the Face in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect of them, that they might move the Mandibles diverſly, and ſome would have it (witneſs <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the muſcles lifting up the Mandibles are great, becauſe they have a great motion, and they are ſoft, becauſe they are next to the Brain.</p>
               <p>And the muſcles depreſſing are ſmall, becauſe it is more eaſie to depreſs the Mandible than to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, and to hold it being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
               <p>But the chawing muſcles are mean, becauſe the circumduction or turning about of the Mandibles is more eaſie than the elevation, and more hard than the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Some will wonder that Nature made the Teeth of chawing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more than they of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; it is to be ſaid, that Nature hath prepared not only teeth to out the meat, but ſhe hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reaſon and Art, which ſhee uſeth for the cutting of meats; Shee hath alſo made the chawers greater, and more, becauſe the chawing action is ſtronger, and

               <p>Beneath thoſe Worms at the ſides of them is a certain eminent part of the Brain, which many doe liken to mens Buttocks in ſhape, which in the lengthning, and in like manner in the ſhutting of the Ventricles doe touch one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but in the ſhortning and opening of them they are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one from another.</p>
               <p>In thoſe aforeſaid Ventricles, in the former part of them there is commonly placed Fantaſie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>About that <hi>Embotum</hi> toward the hinder part, alſo under the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Ventricle, or Ventricles, there is a certain hollowneſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, whoſe walls are like unto the aforeſaid Buttocks, which ſhut and open that hollowneſs when there is need, either from the motion of the aforeſaid worms which are immediately above them, or from another motion cauſed of the ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And that hollowneſs Authors doe commonly put for the middle Ventricle, in which they ſay that the Cogitative vertue is. In the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of this middle Ventricle is a little hole which reacheth to one other hollowneſs, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending toward the place where the beginning of the <hi>Nuca</hi> is; and this hollowneſs is not in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid

               <p>And between that laſt hollowneſs; and the aforeſaid middle Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is a certain glandulous fleſh, called <hi>Conarium,</hi> becauſe it is in the form of a Cone, or Pine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this <hi>glandule</hi> there doth ſuſtain many Veins of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending toward the Center of the Brain, that they may nouriſh it; and this <hi>Glandule</hi> doth ſtrain the ſuperfluous Humidities to the aforeſaid middle Ventricle, from which they are purged, forth to the aforeſaid <hi>Embotum;</hi> and from thence as it appeareth above.</p>
               <p>In that hollowneſs ſpoken of in the laſt place, which is behind the middle Ventricle, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hinder Ventricle, Authors doe commonly place the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55400:164"/> Vertue, but I think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>And I ſay firſt, that the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, Cogitative, and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Vertue are in the firſt of thoſe Cavities placed for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ventricle, as well in the right as in the left, and the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or Common Senſe is in the former part of it, and the Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative in the middle, but in the hinder part of it is the Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>And I ſay, that the aforeſaid Ventricle, which Authors put for the middle Ventricle, is not for the Cogitative Vertue, but is a way for the purging out of many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the Brain, and for the carrying of ſpirits to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid third Ventricle, which ſpirits ſerve not to the Memorative Vertue, but to the Motive and Senſitive Vertue, which come from the aforeſaid firſt Ventricle and are ſerving to the Common Senſe, and from hence it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that the <hi>Nuca</hi> hath ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually its beginning from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55400:177"/> Vertue) doth reach oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the Ears, and perhaps that by reaſon of this the rubbing of thoſe parts doth help the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>Theſe members are covered with Skin, yet they have ſome fleſh very firmly united to their skin; there is not ſenſe in them, unleſs a little; their ſhape is known to all; they are winding as Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wincles, that the air making the ſound might the better flow into them without violence.</p>
               <p>Their perforation is in a bone more thick than any other part of the Skull, within which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hollowneſs, which a certain thin and ſolid Pannicle doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, riſen (according to ſome) from the Auditive Nerve, which is of the fifth pair of the Nerves of the Brain.</p>
               <p>In the aforeſaid hollowneſs, which the aforeſaid Pannicle doth cover before, is implanted air, which receiveth the forms of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which it giveth to the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nerve, dilated into the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55400:178"/> which is called <hi>Miringa Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and then the ſenſe of hearing comprehendeth the Vocal wave, and every other ſound coming to it.</p>
               <p>And to this Pannicle within the aforeſaid hollowneſs, are added two little bones apt to bee moved of the air there in the next moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in their motion doe ſtrike one another, of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome, are cauſed all the forms of ſound more and leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the air moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>

               <p>This Vein called <hi>Aſcellaris,</hi> and <hi>Baſilica,</hi> deſcendeth by the inſide and loweſt part of the Arm, with the Artery fellow to it for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance; after that the Vein is notably manifeſted alone about the juncture of the Cubite in the inward part; and there is fleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and helpeth principally for
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55400:189"/> the Diſeaſes of the Breſt, becauſe it is immediately united to the Veins nouriſhing its parts.</p>
               <p>But from the Neck, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, there doth paſs from the ſhoulders to that Juncture, by the <hi>Adjutory,</hi> one Vein called <hi>Spatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, Humeralis,</hi> and <hi>Cephalica,</hi> which alſo about the Juncture of the Cubite is flebotomiſed, which principally helpeth for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of the Head and Neck, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is immediately united to the Veins <hi>Guidez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between them is one Vein reaching over-thwart from the one to the other, from which it receiveth bloud indifferently; this is called <hi>Nigra, Communis,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> becauſe it emptieth from the members of the Head and Breſt, and conſequently from the whole upper part, by which means it doth alſo empty from the lower parts.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Cephalica</hi> deſcendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for the moſt part, directly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the little hand, between the fore-finger and the thumb,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55400:190"/> and is called of <hi>Albucaſis,</hi> and of <hi>Raſis,</hi> and alſo of me, the true <hi>Funis Brachii,</hi> and of <hi>Cauliacus,</hi> and of <hi>Canamuſalus</hi> it is called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalica ocularis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being cut helpeth in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Head, by reaſon of its Colligancy with the aforeſaid <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalica,</hi> and alſo by reaſon of its directneſs.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Baſilica</hi> deſcending alſo alone almoſt unto the hand, by the inſide, and lower, is obliqued toward the out-ſide about the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hand, which ſendeth forth branches from it between the little and the Ring-finger, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inciſed emptieth from the Breſt by means of the aforeſaid <hi>Baſilica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between thoſe two Veins of the little hand, there are (for the moſt part) ſome Branches between the fore-finger and the middle, and between the middle and the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, which inciſed ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the common Vein; but the branch which is between the fore-finger and the middle, doth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55400:190"/> more participate with the <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> and that which is between the middle and the Ring-finger doth more participate with the <hi>Bafilica;</hi> and from the <hi>Cephalica</hi> above the Cubite by the out-ſide of the arm, doth deſcend one Vein named alſo of many <hi>Funis Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chii,</hi> which for the moſt part is terminated in the aforeſaid Veins being on the ſides of the middle finger; and this <hi>Funis Brachii</hi> is not in uſe for flebotomy, yet it may be inciſed in caſe of neceſſity, and it would carry from the Head, becauſe it is continued with the <hi>Cephalica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There doth alſo often ariſe from the common Vein, which is in, the bending of the Cubite, one branch which doth deſcend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone on the outſide of the branch of the aforeſaid <hi>Cephalica,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the thumbe and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, and therefore ſome have affirmed, that that branch inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doth help in the Diſeaſes, in which the aforeſaid common Vein doth help.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:55400:191"/>
               <p> Many times alſo there doth not any Vein deſcend from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vein between the Fore-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the Thumb, and this I have often noted, not only in that, but in many other Veins I have ſeen them, and alſo Arteries, to differ their ſituation, and in ſome individual theit branches are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and in ſome ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Many times alſo there is a branch between the Fore-finger and the Thumb, compounded of a branch of the <hi>Cephalica,</hi> and a branch of the Common Vein, and then it emptieth from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vein, and from the <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> and more from the <hi>Cephalica</hi> than from the Common, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its greater directneſs; for the directneſs of the Veins to the Members doe make much for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, witneſs <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>De Phlebotomia.</hi>
